## About

This project tests writing to pins (that is, setting HIGH and LOW voltage on certain pins), reading analog data from a photoresistor and working with the time in order to make tasks work in parallel (not exactly in parallel, because Arduino doesn't support that, but more like I used time in order not to rely on delay that makes "parallel" work impossible).

## Hardware
