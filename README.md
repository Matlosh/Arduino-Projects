# Arduino Projects

## About

I like to work with Arduino, but most of my projects are small ones - I wanted to test some concepts, check components and similar. That's why I do not want to create many different and small repositories, because *I like it neat*. I will add all of my Arduino projects here and if I will create something bigger, I'm going to add it as a different repository. Enjoy!

## What will you find here?

Each project contains an image of the circuit (I'll try to add proper circuit schema in the future), code and info about itself.

## What hardware do I use?

Each project can use different components, but my main board is [Arduino Uno Wifi R2](https://store.arduino.cc/en-pl/products/arduino-uno-wifi-rev2).
